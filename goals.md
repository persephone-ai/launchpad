## To Do

check all docstrings are correct and up to date. (build a general ai check for this in the powers folder under "health_check.py") -- explore the idea further of AI systme having its own "powers". i,e adjusting its own parameters and code.

better image transitons between models, i.e return prompt, json, path to save.

streamlit or gradio on top of this.

better logging i.e controlled from gloabl config file, and can be turned on and off.

add finetune lookup by suffix, or time range

logprobs with streaming

then build wandb logging into this.

local cost logging

better audio streaming, and calibration of mic.

update the audio docstringts and input/output to be clearer
